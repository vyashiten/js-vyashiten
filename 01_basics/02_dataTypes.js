"use strict";// treat all JS code as newer version

//alert("hello")
//alert( 3 + 3) // we are using node js, not browser

console.log(3
    +3); console.log("Hiten")//bad code redability

//instead use this practice, code readability should be high
console.log( 3 + 3);
console.log("Hiten")


let name = "hiten"
let age = 18
let isLoggedIn = false

// common datatypes (primitive data types)
// number  = 2 to the power of 52 (or 53) 
// bigint trading, big numbers
// string => ""
// boolean => true/false
// null => standalone value, representation of empty value 
//example: ask for temprature and for somereason there is some issue, i don't want to send 0, 0 is actually a temp, I would prefer sending null
// undefined => value has not been assigned, variable is defined but valueis not assigned, example let state;
// symbol => symbols unique value

//object

console.log(typeof "hiten")
console.log(typeof age)
console.log(typeof null)// null is an object in js
console.log(typeof undefined)//output will be undefined, one type in JS
